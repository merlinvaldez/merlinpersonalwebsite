        <p>
         I started my career as a bilingual elementary educator, where my students taught me that learning works best when it honors who they are and where they come from. 
         That belief carried me into roles as a teacher coach and nonprofit partner manager, and I was the one always tinkering with ways technology could bring our shared vision to life. 
         My wife and I eventually launched our first company, supporting schools and organizations with the design, implementation, and change management of powerful interventions for bilingual, newcomer, and housing-insecure students

         When GenAI took off in early 2023, I saw a way to help teachers plan lessons grounded in students’ lived experiences and the assets of their communities. 
        I co-founded Planningperiod.io, learned to product manage through many user-informed iterations, and even coded simple features and processes when the work called for it. 
        I fell in love with software development because building and deploying systems that solve real pain points helps people create their own paradigm shifts. Today, I am a student at Fullstack Academy, and I want to spend the rest of my life building human-centered tech.
