        <p>
          I co-founded Planning Period because I wanted teachers to design
          curriculum that truly connects with their students. As Head of
          Product, I lived between pedagogy and engineering. I led more than 70
          sprints across three full versions, and turned messy, curriculum
          documents and state standards into something an AI could help with
          without losing the human intent behind each lesson. <br />
          <br />On the technical side, I designed our prompting system from the
          ground up and built a QA process for AI outputs in Python and Jupyter
          using the OpenAI API. I spent long stretches leveraging any library
          and toolset I could find to clean and map large sets of curricular
          content and standards so the system could respond with precision and
          consistency. I also co-designed and tested our PDF processing pipeline
          using the Mistral OCR API, to pull reliable structure from the
          documents teachers actually use. The point of all that engineering was
          simple: give educators responses they can trust, and space to craft
          lessons that feel personal and culturally grounded. <br /><br />
          I was also the face of the business. I secured institutional
          partnerships, onboarded educators, ran workshops, and folded what I
          heard back into the roadmap. I carried the backlog, wrote the epics,
          made the tradeoffs, and kept our small two-person team shipping.
          Building Planning Period is why I committed to becoming a full stack
          developer. Once the problem was meaningful enough, the learning took
          care of itself.

          I built my personal website as part of my Fullstack Academy Web
          Developer Certification course. Though the assignment asked for a pull
          request submission. I wanted it to live in the world. I bought a
          domain, configured DNS, and deployed on Vercel so the site worked like
          a real product from day one. Version 1 is intentionally simple. I
          focused on clear structure, readable typography, and a content flow
          that feels original to me and my story. <br />
          <br />
          I wrote semantic HTML5 so screen readers can navigate the page, kept
          the head clean with sensible meta tags, and organized sections so the
          story is easy to follow. I styled with vanilla CSS, paying attention
          to spacing, type scale, and responsive rules so the layout holds up on
          phones and large screens. Accessibility mattered throughout. I used
          descriptive alt text, labels, and keyboard-friendly navigation so the
          site welcomes more people. I treated the repo like a professional
          project. I created a clean structure, committed in small, descriptive
          increments, and worked through the pull request workflow to satisfy
          the course requirement. I then set up a Vercel project, connected it
          to the main branch, and confirmed that preview builds and production
          deploys were predictable. I connected the custom domain, verified DNS
          and SSL, and added the little touches that make a site feel finished.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is only version 1. In versions 2 and 3 I plan to adopt Tailwind
          to establish a tighter design system and use JavaScript to make the
          site interactive. I want details that respond to the reader without
          getting in the way. That includes stateful components, smoother
          navigation, and motion that supports meaning. The goal is to keep it
          personal and honest while leveling up the craft. <br />
          <br />
          Building this site taught and reinforced the skills I care about. HTML
          and CSS fundamentals. Responsive design. Accessibility from the start.
          Version control discipline, and bringing your project to live in the
          real world after some well intentioned hard work. It is a small site,
          but it reflects how I like to build: start with clarity, ship, learn,
          and then raise the bar in the next version.

        <h3>

        </h3>
        <p>
          I am building anyChangeAi to answer a simple question. Can I make it
          easy to change any document with AI while staying honest about what
          the tech can and cannot do. I will start from a clean Next.js and
          TypeScript base so I can move fast and still keep the code readable
          and testable. The repository lives on GitHub with a project charter
          and an issue board so the work stays visible and traceable from day
          one. <br /><br />

          A core learning goal for me with this project is to understand the
          limits of AI driven development, especially vibe coding. I want to see
          where AI helps me explore ideas and where it slips into guesswork. I
          will document those edges clearly, treat AI as a collaborator, and use
          tests and acceptance criteria to keep me grounded. I also want to find
          the right balance between fast prototyping and disciplined
          engineering. I will prototype quickly in small, reversible steps, then
          dive into what works by writing it down as GitHub issues and shipping
          behind clear commits. I will create and follow a self led project
          charter and implement it through labeled, milestone linked issues so
          anyone can see what I am doing, why it matters, and what is next.
          <br /><br />

          Process matters for this project. I want to follow a proven fullstack
          path using tools that are most common in the industry. Next.js with
          React and TypeScript for the app. Tailwind for a consistent design
          system. Vercel for hosting. GitHub for source control, issues, and CI.
          If the product needs persistence, I will add a relational database
          with and keep schema changes versioned. <br /><br />

          In order to maximize my learning from this project I built a custom
          GitHub Copilot agent called Bootcamp Tutor. Its job is to act like a
          coach who helps me understand the technology and methods behind each
          issue and then directs me on completing the work myself. It will
          reference the charter, link relevant docs, ask clarifying questions,
          and suggest next steps. The goal is learning through practice, not
          outsourcing the solution the way agent mode often does. <br /><br />

          When I ship the first version, the readme will show what the product
          can do, the tradeoffs I made, and the places where AI accelerates me
          versus the places where I need to slow down and think. The end goal is
          not a perfect demo. It is a trustworthy tool that teaches me how to
          build with AI without giving up my judgment.
